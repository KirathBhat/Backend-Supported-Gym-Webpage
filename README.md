# Backend Supporting Gym Form Webpage
This is just a basic webpage which allows a form to have its data be saved locally on a text file "Output.txt" ðŸ˜Ž
Note that the dataset in the text file gets overwritten everytime a new set of data is enterd
# It is not guaranteed that the webpage will be responsive at all on lower-width devices!
